DRY = DONT REPEAT YOURSELF 

Abstraction -> Seperationbetween needed functionality and implementation details, interfaces. 
Encapsulation -> Bundle data and behavior into objects, hide implementation specifics, data behavior. 
Inheratance -> ability to dirive a class from aother class its data and behavior.
polymorphism -> ability a derive class object as though it were base class object, method overloding.
